# Factorio Systems

A recreation of the belt systems as seen in Factorio.

The belts! These can be dynamically placed at runtime, and connect to nearby belts on grid updates. They are simple objects with 8 slots for items, 4 on each side.

As the game plays, they will slowly transfer items on the belts forwards direction, animating them slowing moving. Followed by this, I built a creative item output.

This output block will continutously output items into belts facing away from it. This is used to test the belts and can have items switched out at runtime.
